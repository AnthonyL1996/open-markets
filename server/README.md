# Open Markets — league economy backend (`openmarketsd`)

The online backend for the [Open Markets](../README.md) Cities: Skylines mod. Friends in a **league**
(friend-group scope) share a server-owned economy: a per-commodity **price index** (members report net
supply/demand; the server aggregates + clamps it and layers global price events), plus peer **trade
contracts**, two-sided **trade baskets**, **bonds**/loans, **austerity** with a wall-clock due-clock,
**co-op city levers** (invest/bailout), and leaguemate **city profiles**.

- **Language:** Go, **standard library only** (no external modules → builds and tests offline).
- **Storage:** in-memory with atomic JSON persistence (the `store.Store` interface lets a Postgres
  implementation drop in for production — see `../BACKEND.md`).
- **Deploy target:** self-hosted (home server, VPS, or small cloud instance) behind Cloudflare Tunnel for
  TLS, per `../BACKEND.md`.

## Quick start

```bash
make run                       # listens on :8080, persists to ./data/openmarkets.json
# or
go run ./cmd/openmarketsd
```

```bash
make test     # unit + integration tests
make race     # tests under the race detector
make cover    # coverage
make docker   # build the tiny distroless image
docker compose up --build      # run containerised with a persistent volume
```

Configuration is via `OM_*` environment variables — see [.env.example](.env.example). The aggregation
scale and clamp bounds (`OM_VOLUME_REF`, `OM_INDEX_MIN`/`MAX`) **must match the C# client** (20000 /
0.5 / 2.0) or the two disagree on how far reports move prices.

### Trades (two-sided cash-settled baskets)

A trade is a fixed two-sided deal between two league members: each side lists what it **gives** and
**gets** (a basket of commodities), valued at the live index, over **N installments** (1 = a one-shot
swap; N>1 = a recurring deal). **CS1 cannot force physical cargo**, so a trade is an *accounting overlay*:
each installment the **net payer settles in in-game cash** (the game client on a day rollover; the
operator console on command). The server is the ledger + consent flow only — it never moves money itself,
and an unsettled/defaulted trade must never block a save load (risk is reputational, by design).
Lifecycle: `offered → active → completed` (or `declined`/`cancelled`); a missed installment converts to a
**bond**. (An earlier single-commodity "contract" endpoint was folded into `/trades`.)

**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer <accountId>.<secret>`, or `?account=&secret=` query params on GET
(so a bare `UnityWebRequest.Get` can authenticate without custom headers).

**Index model:** the **effective** index per commodity = `clamp(1 - sum(netSupply)/VolumeRef, Min, Max)`
(the per-league elasticity from members' reports) **× a global price-event multiplier** (a server-side
random spike/slump shared across all leagues), re-clamped to `[Min, Max]`. Net export (positive supply)
lowers the price; net import (negative) raises it. `/prices` returns the per-commodity effective index
(+ the active event % and a rolling history for the sparkline); `/index` returns the mean across commodities
(legacy single-float feed). The in-game client consumes `/prices`.

## Operator console (web UI)

A self-contained operator page is served at **`/console`** (embedded in the binary). Open
`http://localhost:8080/console` in a browser to simulate one or more counterparty cities **visually** —
the graphical twin of `omctl`:

- **Create city** (mints an account; credentials stored per-city in the browser), switch the active city
  from the dropdown to act as several players.
- Create / join a **league** (shows the join code to share with the in-game player).
- **Offer / accept / decline / cancel / settle** contracts **and two-sided trades**; **bonds**/loans; the
  co-op **invest**/**bailout** levers; post **reports**; and watch the **league price index**, the
  **members** roster (with each city's profile + online status), and your **city state** — all auto-refresh
  every few seconds.

Disable in production with `OM_CONSOLE=0` (the page is a thin client — every action still authenticates per
city — but you may not want the UI exposed). It needs no auth itself; the API calls it makes carry the
stored per-city bearer token.

## `omctl` — operator CLI (simulate a city by hand)

Instead of AI bots, you can role-play a counterparty manually. `omctl` is a minimal CLI that stores
credentials in a profile JSON, so you can stand up a "city" and seed a league/contract from the terminal:

```bash
go build -o /tmp/omctl ./cmd/omctl
S=http://localhost:8080
/tmp/omctl -server $S -profile cityB.json account                 # mint an identity
/tmp/omctl -server $S -profile cityB.json league-join -code K7Q2-9F3M
/tmp/omctl -server $S -profile cityB.json offer -to <playerAccountId> \
    -side sell -commodity Oil -qty 2000 -price 140 -n 4 -type supply
/tmp/omctl -server $S -profile cityB.json list
```

Commands: `account`, `league-create`, `league-join`, `report`, `offer`, `list`. For the full operator
surface (accept/settle, trades, bonds/loans, and the co-op levers) use the **web console** (above) — it's
the richer twin of this CLI.
